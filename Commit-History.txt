-> Commit 2 : Restructure and Add Logo
Description: Moved page.tsx to a new folder to keep the project structure organized and added a logo image.
Steps Taken:

2. The page.tsx file serves the same purpose and is treated like a root file.
3. Placed logo.png in the appropriate assets/images folder.
4. Imported and used logo.png in page.tsx.

-> Commit 2 : Auth UI
Description: Moved page.tsx to a new folder to keep the project structure organized and added a logo image.
Steps Taken:
1. Integrated the actions required for signing up within the form.
2. Developed an input component that handles React Hook Form functionality.
3. The component adjusts based on the presence of errors and whether it is disabled.
4. Implemented a feature where the sign-in button gets disabled when necessary.
5. Demonstrated the functionality by disabling the button and showing it visually.
6. Added a 'disabled' property to the inputs, controlled by the isLoading state.
7. Applied this property to each input field (e.g., name, email, password).
8. Verified that clicking the sign-in button disables the input fields and the button itself.
9. Observed that the fields remain disabled since we haven't implemented the logic to reset 'isLoading' to 'false'.
